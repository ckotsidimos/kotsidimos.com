# About

I write and build systems where complexity is the default: distributed technology, distributed decision-making, and distributed accountability.

My work treats organizations as engineered systems. Not as culture problems. Not as transformation theatre. As structures with constraints, feedback loops, and failure modes—operating inside real economic, regulatory, and geopolitical conditions.

What I optimize for

Clarity of intent under uncertainty

Structural autonomy without fragmentation

Flow without loss of control

Governance that scales with speed
